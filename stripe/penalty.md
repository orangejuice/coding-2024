Throughout this interview, we'll write code to analyze a simple server process uptime log.
These logs are much simplified, and are just strings of space separated 0's and 1's.
The log is a string of binary digits (e.g. "0 0 1 0").
Each digit corresponds to 1 hour of the server running:
  "1" = <crashed>, "down" // server process crashed during the hour
  "0" = <didn't crash>, "up" // server process did not crash during the hour

EXAMPLE:
  A server with log "0 0 1 0" ran for 4 hours and its process crashed during hour #3
  hour: |1|2|3|4|
  log : |0|0|1|0|
             ^
             |
             down during hour #3

We can *permanently remove* a server at the beginning of any hour during its operation.
A server is on the network until it is removed.
Note that a server stays POWERED ON after removal, it's just not on the network.
We'd like to understand the best times to remove a server.
So let's introduce an aggregate metric called a "penalty" for removing a server at a bad time.

EXAMPLE:
  Remove a server with log "0 0 1 0"
  hour : | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
  log  : | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
  remove_at: 0 1 2 3 4 // remove_at being `x` means "server removed before hour `x+1`"
             ^     ^
  before hour #1   after hour #4

We define our penalty like this:
  +1 penalty for each DOWN hour when a server is on the network
  +1 penalty for each UP hour after a server has been removed

Further Examples:
  hour : 1 2 3 4 // total penalty = 3 (3 server-up hours after remove)
  log  : 0 0 1 0
         ^
         |
         remove_at = 0

  hour : 1 2 3 4 // total penalty = 1 (1 server-down hour before remove)
  log  : 0 0 1 0
             ^
             |
             remove_at = 4

Note that for a server log of length `n` hours, the remove_at variable can range from 0, meaning "before the first hour" to n, meaning "after the final hour".

1a) Write a function: compute_penalty, that computes the total penalty, given a server log (as a string) AND a time at which we removed the server from the network (call that variable remove_at).
In addition to writing this function, you should use tests to demonstrate that it's correct.

Examples
  compute_penalty("0 0 1 0", 0) should return 3
  compute_penalty("0 0 1 0", 4) should return 1

1b) Use your answer for compute_penalty to write another function: find_best_removal_time, that returns the best remove_at hour, given a server log.
Again, you should use tests to demonstrate that it's correct.

Example
  find_best_removal_time("0 0 1 1") should return 2

2a) Now that we're able to analyze single server logs, let's analyze some aggregate logs.
Aggregate logs are text files that contain lots of logs.
The files contain only BEGIN, END, 1, 0, spaces and newlines.
Aggregate logs include some servers that arenâ€™t actually finished, so we might have some BEGINs scattered throughout.
We'll only consider inner BEGINs and ENDs to be valid log sequences.
Put another way, any sequence of 0s and 1s surrounded by BEGIN and END forms a valid sequence.
For example, the sequence "BEGIN BEGIN BEGIN 1 1 BEGIN 0 0 END 1 1 BEGIN" has only one valid sequence "BEGIN 0 0 END".
Write a function get_best_removal_times, that takes the file's contents as a parameter, and returns an array of best removal hours for every valid server log in that file.
Note: that logs can span 1 or many lines.
Again, you should use tests to demonstrate that your solution is correct.

Example
  get_best_removal_times("BEGIN BEGIN \nBEGIN 1 1 BEGIN 0 0\n END 1 1 BEGIN") should return an array: [2]
